01)Right There:
If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
Then put your hands up

Chef wants to host a party with a total of 
𝑁
N people.
However, the party hall has a capacity of 
𝑋
X people. Find whether Chef can host the party.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
𝑁
N and 
𝑋
X — the total number of people and the capacity of the party hall.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if Chef can host the party and NO otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. That is, the strings NO, no, nO, and No will be treated as equivalent.

03)Bull or Bear
Chef is on his way to become the new big bull of the stock market but is a bit weak at calculating whether he made a profit or a loss on his deal.

Given that Chef bought the stock at value 
𝑋
X and sold it at value 
𝑌
Y. Help him calculate whether he made a profit, loss, or was it a neutral deal.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two space-separated integers 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y, denoting the value at which Chef bought and sold the stock respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output PROFIT if Chef made a profit on the deal, LOSS if Chef incurred a loss on the deal, and NEUTRAL otherwise.

The checker is case-insensitive so answers like pROfiT, profit, and PROFIT would be considered the same.
